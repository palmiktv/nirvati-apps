# Store for Nirvati

This App Store is designed to provide a collection of applications that assist you in your daily work.

## Apps Included

### Jellyfin

Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden fees. More details can be found in the [metadata file](apps/jellyfin/metadata.yml).

### PiHole

Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker. Instead of installing adblockers on every device and every browser, you can install Pi-hole once on your network, and it will protect all of your devices. It blocks ads on any device and improves overall network performance. Pi-hole also has an API, so you can integrate it with your own software. More details can be found in the [metadata file](apps/pihole/metadata.yml.jinja).

### Node-RED

Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single click. More details can be found in the [metadata file](apps/nodered/metadata.yml.jinja).
